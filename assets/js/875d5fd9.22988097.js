This procedure is expected to be an outpatient procedure requiring less than 30 minutes.The power module is designed to be implanted in the torso, typically either chest or abdomen, because these portions of the body can accommodate the power module package size.

The power module utilizes a 32 bit ARM-7 microprocessor, the NXP Semiconductor LPC2129 processor. The processor runs a real time operating system (RTOS). During functional operation, the power module primarily functions as the power source for the entire implanted NNP system. However, due to its significant processing power, it is capable of performing signal processing and data storage in support of the remote module functions when required.
