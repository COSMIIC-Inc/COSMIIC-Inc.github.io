The neural system supports bidirectional communication with the modules throughout various regions of the body using wired or wireless connections. The subsystem modules themselves can include sensors for EEG, EMG, EOG, and accelerometers, while also having drug delivery devices and stimulators. A fundamental innovation is that a controller \u2014 in real time \u2014 is able to reassign devices with the network system to adapt to changing needs, which is able to improve scalability. The neural prosthesis system\u2019s vision is for complete implantation and also have external devices intended for programming, diagnostics, and communication.

Specifically, it uses a toroidal canted coil spring that is embedded in a spring-receiving cavity around a longitudinal shaft bore. There is a connector pin with a longitudinally asymmetrical V-groove that can slide into the bore. Upon insertion, the V-groove of the pin aligns with the toroidal canted coil spring and a part of the spring can enter the groove, which is known as a maintenance position. This was carefully designed so that insertion of the pin into the spring needs just a modest force, but retraction needs a much larger force due the shape of the V-groove and spring interaction. This asymmetric force response provides a clear mechanical security against unintended disengagement but when the large retraction force threshold is met, there can be intended disengagement. The patent also covers various methodologies for pin insertion and removal by chronicling the force differentials."}),"\n"]}),"\n"]})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:n}={...(0,r.R)(),...e.components};return n?(0,t.jsx)(n,{...e,children:(0,t.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}},8453:(e,n,s)=>{s.d(n,{R:()=>o,x:()=>a});var i=s(6540);const t={},r=i.createContext(t);function o(e){const n=i.useContext(r);return i.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(n):{...n,...e}}),[n,e])}function a(e){let n;return n=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(t):e.components||t:o(e.components),i.createElement(r.Provider,{value:n},e.children)}}}]);
